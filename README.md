## **Introduction**

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication, behavior, and social interaction. Individuals with ASD may exhibit a wide range of abilities and challenges. Some common features include difficulty with social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and sensitivity to sensory input. However, the presentation of ASD varies greatly between individuals. In this project we explore the use of deep learning techniques combined with eye-tracking technology for the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD). Early diagnosis is crucial for effective intervention, yet it often occurs around the age of 4, despite earlier symptom onset. Eye-tracking technology offers a promising, cost-effective, and non-invasive method for early diagnosis by capturing eye movement data that can serve as biomarkers for ASD. Here, we analyze an eye-tracking dataset using enhanced image processing techniques to extract critical visual features. This study introduces a hybrid classification approach that integrates multiple deep learning models, including GoogleNet, ResNet, XceptionV3, DenseNet, Xception, and MobileNet, to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) detection. These features were then processed through a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of multiple deep learning architectures, significantly improving the accuracy of ASD diagnosis. This approach successfully distinguishes ASD cases from typical development (TD) cases, offering a robust tool for early detection and contributing to better treatment strategies.
